# 4 - Add an Agent Flow for Approving Warranty Claims

Now that we have an AI prompt that can classify warranty claims and extract key info, we’re going to wrap this process in a formal, approval path based off of certain conditions like if it's in the warranty period. This is exactly what Agent Flows are for: augmenting your agents with a configurable and predictable decision path. In this section, you’ll build an agent flow that reads the extracted fields, evaluates the policy conditions, and triggers an auto approval if those conditions are met.

1. Select **Overview** to get back to the overview of the agent

1. To create a new agent flow, scroll down to the Tools section and select **Add Tool**
    ![New Tool](./assets/NewToolAgentFlow1.png)

1. Select **Agent Flow**. This will route you to a new agent flow that you'll need to configure.

    ![Agent Flow](./assets/add-agent-flow.png)

1. You'll see two items on the screen, the trigger which kicks off the flow and the response which returns data back to the agent. The first thing we need to do is configure any inputs that we want to pass into our flow from the agent to use in the flow. To add these inputs, select the **When an agent calls the flow** trigger.
